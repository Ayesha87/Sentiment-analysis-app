          <h1>Sentiment Analysis in Hindi</h1>
          <p>Sentiment Analysis in Hindi is very challenging because hindi is a resource scarce language which causes problems in collection and generation of datasets. Also, there are not efficient parsers and taggers for this language. </p>
          <p>Text sentiment analysis in hindi is done by performing the Resource based classification using HindiSentiWordNet(H-SWN). Each word present in the H-SWN has a positive and a negative sentiment score. Based on the maximum of the scores, a polarity is assigned to each word in a text. The polarity which covers the maximum number of words in a text is predicted as the sentiment of that text. </p>
